Manually triggered elections:
Make an account trigger the election. If new officials are elected, the incoming elected are incentivized to trigger it and willing to pay the cost of running the election. If nobody bothers to trigger the election, just keep the current elected officials.
Just have to make sure the economics are right so that electing new officals is prohibitively expensive and we get stuck with the status quo.
