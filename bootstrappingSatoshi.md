# Bootstrapping Steve
A practical guide to healthy multiple personalities

Story of Ralph, a real person, and Steve his secret identity. Specifically, how Ralph begat Steve, and how you can do the same.

Ralph is a normal guy, credit card, passport, facebook account. His goal is to create a significantly anonymous identity making practical compromises only when necesssary. Making his own satoshi.

Disclaimer: I'm not suggesting these steps are ready for anonymity-critical operations yet. Rather I'm putting them out there for peer review. Feedback welcome.

Why does Ralph want to do this? Sadly, we don't know. Ralph's motivation is hidden away in his own head, and the best we can do is speculate about it. Some possible reasons are:
* Hire a hitman
* Donate to a charity without being publically praised
* As a fun learning endeavor
* Evade taxes
* Coordinate a terrorist attack
* Leak terrorist secrets to the good guys from inside
* Buy perscription drugs at aftermarket prices
* Perform honest journalism under a corrupt government
* Evade taxes demanded by a corrupt government
* Be citizen 4 (link to something about snowden)

Some of these reasons are good and some aren't. If we spend all our time worried about helping a bad Ralph, we'll miss lots of opportunities to help good Ralphs. <pre></philosophy></pre>

## Ralph Got Some Monero
Tried earning it, tried selling something for it, mined some, paid cash from local monero. Didn't have enough so he bought some BCH on coinbase and used changelly.

## Ralph Gets a free VPN
Ralph has been experimenting with a little torrenting recently, and got a letter from his ISP. He isn't that worried and doesn't do it that often, but one of his friends recommended a VPN, so he decided to try. ProtonVPN looked good, and he thought is was cool that they were accepting bitcoin -- just in case he ever did want to pay.

## Albert Downloads Ubuntu
Live Persistent Linux Drive to use as his main computer. He downloads it over Ralph's VPN without asking Ralph's permission.



## Albert Gets his own VPN
Boots his live disk for the first time ever. This is the only OS instantiation Albert will ever use. He sets up a free protonmail and proton vpn account to do some preliminary business.

## Albert obtains a ledger
Maybe through purse.io, maybe by paying for it with cash, maybe by picking it out of Ralph's garbage can. Picks one out of ralph's trach can, just to see if it works. Turns out it doesn't. Suddenly one appears on craigslist so he coordinates a local meetup in a public place through proton mail account, or a one-off account. He goes and pays cash. The seller clearly didn't understand much about the device and even gave Albert his old pin. Albert decided to see whether anything was left on it and it turned out there was a little BCH on there. He decided to leave it in place so as not to raise suspicion 

## Albert generates keys
Any kind of cryptocurrency, also gpg, ssh, whatever else. They're all generated on the ledger which means the key will never be on a network connected device.


## Albert buys Ralph's Monero
After a short email exchange probably best to use a throw-away email account here. We're only trying to avoid links between albert and ralph.

## Albert gets his own VPN
Upgrades to paid protonvpn and protonmail account paying with btc changelly'ed from the monero he bought from ralph. He sure wishes protonVPN would support Monero directly. He can finally add a subkey of his new gpg key to his proton mail account.

## Now he's off and running
publishes his gpg key
joins reddit
etc



## VPN provider snitches
Someone used my VPN to download ubuntu? I certainly didn't allow that? Did I get hacked?
